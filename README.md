nicar-tweets
============

**What**: A quick script using the Twitter python library and the Twitter search API to pull and store in csv the annual #NICAR tweets.


From Twitter's [search API documentation](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search):

>Before getting involved, itâ€™s important to know that the Search API is focused on relevance and not completeness. This means that some Tweets and users may be missing from search results. If you want to match for completeness you should consider using a Streaming API instead.

The search API is also rate-limited. More information on that [here](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting).

**What is here?**:

* [_#NICAR17_tweets.csv](_%23NICAR17_tweets.csv): Pulled from a date range of 2/26/17 and 3/6/17.
* [_#NICAR16_tweets.csv](_%23NICAR16_tweets.csv): Pulled from a date range of 3/7/16 and 3/14/16.
* [_#srccon_tweets.csv](_%23srccon_tweets.csv): Pulled from a date range of 6/23/15 and 6/27/15.
* [_#IRE15_tweets.csv](_%23IRE15_tweets.csv): Pulled from a date range of 6/3/15 and 6/9/15.
* [_#NICAR15_tweets.csv](_%23NICAR15_tweets.csv): Pulled from a date range of 3/3/15 and 3/10/15.

* Configure init_search.py
    * There are a handful of variables to change.
